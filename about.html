      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Making professional therapy accessible, affordable, and convenient — so anyone who struggles with life’s challenges can get help, anytime and anywhere.</p>
  
      <h3>What we &hearts; doing</h3>
      <p>At some point in our lives, someone loved us enough to listen to us with compassion and ask us wise questions. And hope was kindled in our hearts.</p>
       <p> Now, as online mentors, we want to offer people a similar opportunity. If you think that talking with one of us might help, simply fill out the form below. We will contact you as soon as possible and will continue corresponding with you for as long as you want.</p> 
       <p> We are offering this service completely free of charge because that is what friends do. Know that any contact information you share will only be used to communicate with you in a safe and confidential manner and will never be shared with a third party.</p>
